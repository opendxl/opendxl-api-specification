      description: DXL service hosted by the McAfee MAR Server. The MAR Search topic
        operates similarly to a RESTful API, and supports multiple request formats.
        As such, the definition of the Request/Response supported by '/mcafee/mar/service/api/search'
        is split into several subsections.

    description: Notifies the MAR server to create a new search using a specified
      set of parameters. After creation the search ID provided in the response can
      be used to start an instance of the search using a 'Start Search'-formatted
      request on this same DXL topic or through the MAR UI. Creation of a MAR search
      requires a list of 'projections' and an optional dictionary containing the search
      'conditions'.

  Projection Object:
    type: object
    description: Projections are used to describe the information to collect in the
      search. Each projection consists of a collector name and a list of output names
      from the collector. For example, the "Processes" collector includes output names
      such as "name", "sha1", "md5", etc. For a complete list of collectors and their
      associated output names refer to the McAfee Active Response Product Guide.

  Base Condition Object:
    type: object
    description: Conditions are used to restrict which items are included in the search
      results. For example, a search that collects process-related information could
      be limited to those processes which match a specified name. A condition has
      a fixed structure starting with an 'or' conditional operator and allowing only
      one level of 'and' conditions.
