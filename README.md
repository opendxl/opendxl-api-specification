# OpenDXL API Specification

The OpenDXL API Specification defines a standard interface description for
applications which connect to the
[McAfee Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx)
(DXL) messaging fabric. The specification provides a mechanism for describing the
API for DXL-based solutions, including:

* [Services](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/dxlclient.service.html)
  that solutions register with a DXL fabric.
* [Events](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/dxlclient.message.html#dxlclient.message.Event)
  that solutions send to a DXL fabric.
* [Requests](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/dxlclient.message.html#dxlclient.message.Request)
  which can be made to a service through a DXL fabric (and the
  corresponding [responses](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/dxlclient.message.html#dxlclient.message.Response)
  that the service produces).

The OpenDXL API Specification is heavily inspired by the work done in the
[OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) to
describe
[REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
Where possible, schema definitions in the OpenDXL API Specification
utilize corresponding definitions in the OpenAPI Specification. For example,
the core
[Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schema-object)
from the OpenAPI Specification is used by the OpenDXL API Specification to
define the
[payload](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/dxlclient.message.html#dxlclient.message.Message.payload)
for a DXL message.

## Draft Version - 0.1

The draft version of the OpenDXL API Specification is
[OpenDXL API Specification 0.1](versions/0.1.md).

## Schemas

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) documents which can be used for
syntactic validation of an OpenDXL API document reside in the
[schemas](schemas) directory. The schema for the latest specification version
is [here](schemas/v0.1/schema.json).

## Examples

Current OpenDXL API document examples include:

* ACME [[json](examples/v0.1/json/acme.json)] [[yaml](examples/v0.1/yaml/acme.yaml)] -
  Simple example which utilizes each of the major schema components to describe
  an API - solutions, services, requests, and events.
